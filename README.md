A decentralised, censorship-resistant image hosting service using IPFS and Filecoin (web3.storage).  

This project consists of an API and two frontends for that API - a CLI and a web frontend. Both are built to perform three operations: `upload`, `fetching` and `homepage view`. Users can upload an image and an IPFS content-ID is returned for that image. For the CLI, the homepage is loaded as previews of the images as ASCII art, along with their CIDs.  

**Why IPFS?**  
IPFS (Inter-Planetary File System) is  
>A peer-to-peer hypermedia protocol
>designed to preserve and grow humanity's knowledge
>by making the web upgradeable, resilient, and more open.
